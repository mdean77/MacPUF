This project is a translation of the original MacPuf program written by C.J. Dickinson
in the late 1970s using Fortran.  The Fortran source is slowly being translated into
Cocoa;  I began this project in 2001 with very early Cocoa interfaces.

Information about progress in the early years is in Progress Logbook.
